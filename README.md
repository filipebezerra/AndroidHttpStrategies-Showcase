===================

Android app demo showing how to consume restful services using 4 different strategies: AsyncTask, AQuery, Volley and Retrofit 2.

About
-----

This repository tends to be a laboratory study and demonstration experiments in the consumption of RESTful services on Android.

Among the main topics covered in this study will be the use of the APIs of Android SDK itself and libraries maintained by the Android development community to demonstrate the different strategies to use these services based on Rest and JSON.

The main purpose and learn to use and apply best practices with the SDK and libraries to consume these services and perform the conversion of the JSON to object using several different strategies as Gson, Jackson and Logan Square, etc.

This study also involves application of best practices and solid principles of programming as use of design patterns and oriented programming interfaces, etc.
